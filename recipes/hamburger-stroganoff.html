        <p>Ground beef stroganoff is one of those comforting meals that is quick and easy to make, plus it can feed your whole family with a shortlist of ingredients! How about a hearty meal of beef stroganoff in less than 25 minutes? Count me in, this is perfect for a busy weeknight!</p>
        <p>This easy Ground beef stroganoff recipe is made from scratch with fresh ingredients (and without cream of mushroom soup). I love dishes that come together so quickly (like Cabbage and Noodles or 20 Minute Fajitas) and even more so when everyone at the table wants seconds!</p>
